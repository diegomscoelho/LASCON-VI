#Impairment of dendritic spines and neuronal activity on alzheimer related models
The main objective of this study is create a more realistic biological model for CA1 cells and reanalyze results from 
previous Alzheimer related models. Alzheimer disesase (AD) is a world widespread mental illness and has a huge research
data, however it has just a few models (1) directly related to them. Previous works had shown a relation between dendritic
spines and Alzheimer disease (2-3), nonetheless old models did not have these morphological property that seems to be 
important for normal synaptic fuction. To achieve our objectives, we will use NEURON software which is a very common 
utility that covers from electrophysioligical till morphological issues. As results, a retrieval of CA1 cells functionality 
is expected, because dendritic spines could enhance optimization of synaptic activity. Therefore, we might achieve a new 
model for Alzheimer disease.
